Here are some of the completed tests.

- task_1

We propose to conduct a system analysis and comparison of texts in PHP:

The text field where the user enters the first version of the text.
The text field where the user enters the second version of the text.
Compare button
Stick to the first version of the text with changes from the first text.

- New offers should be highlighted in light green.
- Changed offers should be highlighted in yellow.
- Deleted offers should be highlighted in red.
- When assigning the mouse cursor, the modified (yellow) sentence should be changed to the first version.
(when the focus of the modified offer is propagated, the new version is visible again).
